*How meta!*

I’ve always taken pride in the things I created. This portfolio site is no different, it’s just another chance to show my craft. Here is the creative process.

I began by doing research on what makes portfolios stand out. At first, I thought it may be helpful to create something flashy, with tons of animations and transitions between pages and elements. I tend to become infatuated with flashy creations. But, I know that what I need is a site that accurately captures the skills I have as a UX Designer.

Being an effective UX Designer doesn’t simply mean you shoehorn your content into flashy things but that you are organizing content, pages, elements, and information in the most sensible manner. So, I mocked up the information I wished to show in Figma. [I included the Figma prototype for this portfolio here!](https://www.figma.com/proto/CDR9fePXJCS0CpUmNwgWgE/Resume-and-Portfolio?node-id=25%3A1618&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=25%3A1617)

I created simple components that I could use throughout the project. This included colors, typography, and content elements, such as the postcard components and buttons. I thought about what information the user will see first and concluded that most of my experience should appear on the home page. In the near future, I would love to add a section to hold my side projects such as graphic, logo, and branding design.

The part I am most proud of about this site is it being built using React. Prior to being a UX Designer, I set out to be a Front-End Developer. I was fortunate to have multiple internship opportunities while I was studying at San Jose State University. During those internships, I grasped a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

For this site, I used a site builder library called [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), written using React. What I love about this site is how simple it is to create pages and properly manage the links between them. Gatsby also has the ability to download styling frameworks, like SASS, from the get-go. I especially love the ease of implementing a content management system, like [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), to make publishing posts like this one, quick and easy.

The ultimate benefit of building my portfolio with React is the control. As someone who spends way too much time making sure the pixels in my prototypes line up, having complete control over how the site is rendered is a dream come true. React truly helps me craft this site meticulously, just like how any creative person would.

At the time of creating this post, you can see that this live site is only a fraction of what I mocked in Figma. I plan to continue to add more content as time permits so please stay tuned for more projects in the future!
