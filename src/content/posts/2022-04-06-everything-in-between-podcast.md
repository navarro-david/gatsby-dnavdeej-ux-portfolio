  Landing page for the podcast, Everything in Between. Created with React.js


  Everything in Between is a Christian podcast where we sit down with a variety of people to discuss stories, beliefs, theology, and everything in between. Our mission is to have a conversation with people that have varying opinions and beliefs, and maybe even shorten the distance between us.

Simple landing page created for my buddies Daniel Kunkle and Scott Bolin's podcast. Visitors can even listen to the podcast directly from the site.

For this project, my role was a **Full-Stack Designer**, as I took the time to understand the client's needs, designed the website layout, and implemented the site with code. The site pulls in updates from a [BuzzSprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw9LSSBhBsEiwAKtf0n11DN_Otj5PjTkIUrqdugDcIintt7pK0umdwLlD862tBVxzrrhXVCRoCht4QAvD_BwE) API. This plugin was created by [ChanceTheDev](https://chance.dev/). The UI is created with React.js and Gatsby.js.
