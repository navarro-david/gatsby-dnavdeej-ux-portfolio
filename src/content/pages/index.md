UX Designer by day, gamer by night, and plant parent all hours in between! When I am not collaborating with global teams to innovate new ways to keep the trucking industry safe and cost-effective, I'm catching *dubs* with my wife in duos!

I design for people, not users. I excel at empathizing with thier pain-points and understanding what causes them.
