Coffee powered, rock climbing, UX designer, plant parent. **whew!** 

I excel at empathizing with people's pain points and innately understanding what causes them. I've been in the tech industry since 2015 as a front-end developer and now a UI/UX designer and researcher. I am skilled in innovating SAAS, industry-leading, enterprise software.

**Design for people, not just users.** This is how we understand complex problems to create intuitive and powerful solutions.
