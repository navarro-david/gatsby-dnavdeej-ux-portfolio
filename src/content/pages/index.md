Currently, I am the main point person for UI Design solutions in our company. I am truly grateful to be challenged in this role given that I have recently completed my BS in Computer Science from SJSU in 2018. In this amount of time, I have been able to acquire a robust design skill set that I did not have straight out of college. From my 6 years of experience of front-end internships and my current UI Design position, I have been able to develop a deep understanding of both respective fields.\
\
As a designer, I am always iterating on better ways to solve solutions. If I had it my way, I would want to push out a new and better design every month! My favorite part of being a designer is being part of the visionary process. I love being able to solve complex problems and collaborating close to project managers to achieve effective solutions.\
\
I work well alone and within teams. I get the job done at home and in the office. (Or even in a coffee shop!) Give me a problem to solve and I won't stop thinking about it until we have a solid solution to chase and work with.
